## About Pomowork (work in progress)

Pomowork is a software that allows you to manage projects, using pomodoros, assign them a price per hour (optional) and not worry about the rest. Pomowork will automatically create a card each day where the number of pomodoros and the money generated that day will be saved, allowing you to confirm if the hours have been charged.

## Known issues

- You can start a timer without having created any project
- Input validation when modifying the name or price does not work
- The program crashes if the email already exists when creating a user
- Weird stuff when pressing enter in the login error popup
